# TIL (Today I learned)

A MERN web-app code notebook

Basically a recreation of [VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/) entirely in React.

## what is this??????????

Take notes in markdown, that's it B-) 
Markdown text is saved in a mongodb database and when fetched, is parsed and compiled into html with [marked.js](https://marked.js.org/). 

Inspired by : https://github.com/milooy/TIL

Instead of hosting data through saving in the repository, I wanted to have it run through a database for ease.
